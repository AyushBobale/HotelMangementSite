# HotelMangementSite
This is a hotel managment site made in Python's Flask framework and can be run on repl.it as the code is hosted there as well as a public repository it was my first venture in Flask framework so the code is a bit bootleg.

This site was created as a part of semester project and was first time working with flask as it was a semester project we the students were also supposed to exlore and understand the software development cycle and did realted things such as designing the database, writing classed, desiging the activity diagram, testing, system design, etc.
